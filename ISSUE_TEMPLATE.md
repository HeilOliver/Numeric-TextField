Do the checklist before filing an issue:
------------------------------------------------------------------

- [ ] Is this something you can **debug and fix**? Send a pull request! Bug fixes and documentation fixes are welcome.
- [ ] Have an idea for a feature? Feel free to create an Issue with added 'Feature' Label


If its realy an Bug.
------------------------------------------------------------------

Make sure to add **all the information needed to understand the bug** so that I can help. 
If the info is missing I'll add the 'Needs more information' label and close the issue until there is enough information.

- [ ] Provide a **minimal code snippet** example that reproduces the bug.
